This is a simple card game involving a single player and the dealer. The dealer will deal two cards face up in sequential order. The bettor will be able to look at the cards and decide if they'd like to bet. Their bet is whether a third card will fit in the range between the two cards. If the card comes up between them then they win! If not they lose...
